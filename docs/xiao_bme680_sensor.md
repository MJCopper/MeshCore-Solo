# XIAO nRF52840 BME680 Sensor

[Back to README](../README.md)

The `Xiao_nrf52_bme680_sensor` target creates a display-free MeshCore
environmental sensor using a XIAO nRF52840, SX1262 and BME680. It measures once
per minute, serves current telemetry on request and answers rate-limited
`!hillvue` queries on the built-in Public channel.

The firmware is a leaf node. It receives traffic addressed to the sensor and
listens for its Public-channel command, but it does not forward packets for
other nodes.
